In the world of programming, Core Java with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles forms the foundational knowledge for developers. Core Java covers essential concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. By mastering these, you gain the ability to design efficient and maintainable software.

For practical application, consider two projects during your industrial training. First, develop a robust inventory management system using Java. Utilize OOP principles to model products, categories, and transactions. Second, build a simple e-commerce website with Java servlets and JSP, incorporating user authentication and product catalog functionality. These projects will empower you to implement Java and OOP concepts in real-world scenarios, enhancing your programming skills for a successful career.
